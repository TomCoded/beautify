----------------------

demo:

log into basuto (or another machine with plaympeg).

chdir to the Scene/ directory.

run the script demo

----------------------

Sample output files:

There are sample output movies in the Scene/movies/ folder.
There are sample output stills in the Scene/stills/ folder.

----------------------
Compilation instructions:

gmake in the root project directory will make the project.

. retry in the Scene directory will do the same.

gmake funtest will make the executable funtest, which allows you to
test the functionality of the function parser / evaluator.

gmake kdTest will make the executable kdTest, which runs some simple
tests on the kdTree system.

-------------------------

Running the programs:

Executable is Scene/SceneTest

Keys:
 's': Saves the image on screen to a file.
 'r': Redisplays the image.  Does not re-render.
 't': Applies a smoothing filter to the image.
 'q': Quits

Known Bugs/Working On:

For the moment, If a light source is contained within an object, the
light source's photons do not impact the object; they penetrate its
surface and illuminate other objects in the scene as if it did not
exist.  This is deliberate.

---------------------------
Program usage:

SceneTest asks for a scenefile to load when it is started up.

You then generate a new photon map, telling it how many photons to
use.  Ranges from 1000 to 1000000 make sense, depending on the number
of lights in the scene, the density of the scene, the presence or
absence of participating media, etc...  Try one or two thousand
first.  This many photons will be emitted from light sources, but only
a few of them will hit objects.

The (d) button will then display the photon map.  (q) with the
keyboard focus on the graphic window will quit.  (s) with the keyboard
focus on the graphic window will wait for a filename at standard in,
and save the image to that file when the user hits return.  Note that
the file extension is necessary.

-----------------------------
Creating a movie

To create a movie, start SceneTest.

Press (l) to load a file.
Enter the filename.
Press (c) to generate frames.
You will be prompted for:
	The number of frames to produce.
	The Change in the variable t with per frame.
	The base filename - ex: "ten" for ten frames
	  produces "ten0.jpg" through "ten9.jpg"
	The number of photons to use in each image.  The more photons,
	  the longer it will take.
When it's done rendering, type (q) to quit.

To convert to a movie, run:

~03jda/bin/ffmpeg -y -an -r 10 -i <filename>%d.jpg <filename>.mpg

To view the movie, log into basuto and run:

plaympeg <filename>.mpg
