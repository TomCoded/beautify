Scene File Format Specification:

windowDims (integer, integer)
  - specifies width and height of output images.

camera (location,lookAt,up,?,?,?,far)
  - places camera at location location, looking at lookAt, oriented
s.t. up is the top.  

DiffusePointLight(power,location,specular)
  - creates a diffuse point light source at the specified location.
  - specular reflects the specular intensity of each color channel.
  - power reflects the total power of all photons present in the light
source.

Material (ambient,diffuse,specular,specular exponent)
  - ambient is unused in global illumination algorithm

Participating (ambient,diffuse,specular,specular exponent,scatterring
coefficient)
  - ambient is unused in global illumination algorithm
  - scattering coefficient determines density of medium.
     - the higher the coefficient, the more dense the medium.

Transformations:

translate (x,y,z)
  - translates specified object

funTransform 00 01 02 03 10 11 12 13 20 21 22 23 30 31 32 33
  - creates a transform that is a function of time.  Accepted valued
for 00-33 entries in matrix include:
     - arbitrary polynomials
     - sin(f) and cos(f) where f is any function that can be parsed.
     - addition, multiplication, division, exponentiation
     - functions of time t
     - The parser may have issues with leading minus signs; when in
        doubt, use "0-<whatever>" instead of "-<whatever>"
  - YOU MUST SPECIFY THE INVERSE OF THIS TRANSFORMATION for it to
work, and potentially the appropriate inverse normal transformation.

funTransformInverse
  - same as above, but for the transformation from world coordinates
to local coordinates.
